# Flappy-Bird-with-Neat-Python
 Learning to Code Flappy Bird and an AI to play it.

 This code original idea belongs to youtuber Teach With Tim. 

 This is his full playlist tutorial with all an explanation:

  This proyect uses pygame library and neat-python module.
  
  Pygame is a group of methods for building games, with a lot of render, movement, animation and game build.
  
  NEAT is an artificial inteligence module. NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks.
  You can read a full documentation in the link bellow:

  NEAT makes a statistic model processing calculations based on a lot of parameters represented by specific variables with specific variables. The neuronal network learns how to play by creating a population of entities that will go through the game, either losing or making constant advancement, the algorithm will see wich of the entities will make a better progress and will save this data to apply it to the next generation of entities to create. Basically, this works under the concept of Natural Selection, the entities that get better will make the pattern for the next ones so the AI will gradually learn how to avoid obstacles in order to get a better advancement.
